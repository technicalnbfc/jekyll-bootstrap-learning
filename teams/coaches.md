__Senior Men's Capital League:__

__Head coach:__ Anj Sandhar. Anj has coached the top men's team since we returned to Football Brisbane competition in 2015. Last year he successfully guided the top team to second spot and so secure promotion to Capital League 2. Bolstered by some quality off-season signings, offset it has to be said by some key players from last season moving on, Anj is facing an interesting challenge to mould the undoubted talent that exists into a top 4 team. 

__City League:__

__Div 3:__ Thomas Connolly. Tom has been closely associated with qutfc and so brings to the table an extensive knowledge of qut students and their abilities. After taking a year off due to injury, his coaching skills were on display during the University Games and, largely due to that experience, has decided to take on a coaching role this year. 

__Div 5:__ TBA

__Div 7:__ Carlo Borzellega. Carlo has a long association with the Grange, coaching and playing in City league teams there for a number of years. This year he has decided to join a bunch of mates who will be calling North Brisbane home. Welcome to our team Carlo.

__Senior Women's Capital League:__

__Head Coach:__ Greg Vitulano. Greg has extensive experience coaching teams across all demographics for the last 40 or so years. He has held the reins for the top women's teams for the past 2 years, during which period the team was crowned City Div 4 premiers in 2016 and finished in the top 4 in City Div 2 in 2017, having made the rare move to jump 2 divisions. With a few key additions to the top squad this year, Greg is confident that the team can continue its development and be very competitive in the Capital League. 

__City Div 3/4 Coach:__ Adnan Catakovic. Adnan similarly possesses a vast array of coaching experience across all demographics. He took charge of the div 5 side early on in the 2017 season and did a stellar job on their skills development, with the side also finishing in the top 4. 

__City Div 5 Coach:__ TBA

__Assistant Coach:__ Lino Del Vecchio. Lino first became involved in the women's program last year as a strength and conditioning/sports trainer and is hugely respected by the players for his commitment and professionalism. Lino will continue in that role with a focus on being the assistant coach for the women's Capital League side.

__Fitness and Conditioning:__ Kim Bowman. Kim is studying exercise science and is passionate about improving the fitness and well-being of our senior women. She is responsible for our fitness and conditioning regime this year.

__Club Physio:__ Bill Ingledew, principal of 4tfi physiotherapy. Bill joins our team this year, having been a player of some repute during our club's halycon days in the top division in the early to mid 1990s. Someone from his clinic will be down once a week to triage player injuries. His clinic can be found at Cardigan house, Sandgate Road Nundah.  

__Sports trainers:__ Lino Del Vecchio and Kristin Knill. Lino and Kristin will take care of the match day needs of the men's and women's Capital League teams and also be present one night a week to attend to any niggling aches and pains that beset any club players.

Wayne played in the old National Soccer league as a keeper and had local first division experience, mostly with North Brisbane and Brisbane City.
